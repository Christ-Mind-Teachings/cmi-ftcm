## I. Prelude

Divine soul, created by the love of the Father of all true creation! Once again
we have come for love to remind you of the origin of all origins, to fully
satisfy the natural impulse of the soul to know where it comes from, where it
resides, and where it goes.

Everything was created by love, including you.

Before explaining what the memories of the soul reveal, be still. Stay very
quiet in the presence of the love that you are. Five minutes of your time is
more than enough. Even one minute. Just stay in the stillness of your soul, in
that peace that you are, where the sweetness of love dwells. Enter that refuge
of your minds and hearts where the world is left behind and only the radiant
knowledge of truth remains. You are alone but not lonely. There, in that sacred
space of your heart, you are one with us, with everything, and with God. There
is regained the memory of the joy of union. There you remember that you are a
soul. You are light. You are peace. You are perfect discernment. You are the
solace of love. You are a drop of crystalline water emanating from the ocean of
infinite love that is the Father. Remain very quiet in that sacred place. Be
silent and listen with your heart to that of which we have come to remind you.

Now that you have been silent and are reconnected with the source of your
being, your soul, you are in perfect condition to receive with your heart what
comes from above and is given as a gift of eternal love.

Maybe some of you believe that talking about these things is meaningless. Some
may not understand everything said here. It does not matter. The purpose of
this work is to expand your consciousness through the healing of memory. The
word of God is effective. It always fulfills its purpose. These words are no
exception. We remind you that when we say “this work,” we refer to everything
received and given through the scribe “A Soul in Love,” a pencil in the hands
of love. Do not get distracted by the form of humanity who receives these
messages but focus on the messages themselves. You are each receivers of these
words. They were written for you. By your will you are receiving them with
love. When you receive them, you make them one with you.

What each of you do with these words is unique because you each respond in your
particular way to the word of God, reflecting the individuality of your own
being. No two souls are identical. These words spring from the depths of a soul
and are said for the soul. Understand this as a true act of humility of one who
lovingly knows that these words are not his but Christ’s, even though they are
expressed in his mind and heart just as they are in every mind and heart
thirsting for love and truth. Children of love, this is humility. Never forget
to be humble of heart, as is he who, for the simple reason of charity, shares
these words to give light to your soul.

## II. The Memory of Who You Are

We assure you in spirit and truth that once you finish receiving these words
and welcome them with love, whether or not you understand—and as you apply no
effort but do it for the simple joy of being alone with us as we enjoy being in
divine union with you—that little by little you will begin to remember God
because you will begin to remember your self. First it will be a small flash of
light, a feeling of bliss. You will feel intuitively that you are much more
than a body and a personality. It will be like a small musical note from a
beautiful melody that, although loved, was forgotten. Then you will open
yourself to mystery. And in less time than it takes a rooster to crow three
times you will meet yourself and be surprised. Almost without realizing it, you
will remember more and more the boundless truth of the self that you are, and
joyfully accept that you do indeed know the voice you hear.

Once spiritual memory is healed, words or messages of any kind will no longer
be necessary because, when you remember who you really are, you know. You know
without any mental activity, without the effort of thinking.

Every moment you spend receiving the words of this work— either through the
eyes reading the words, or through the ears that hear the spoken word—you are
returning to the consciousness of the truth of what you are. You are
returning to the Father’s house. You are being reborn in the presence of love.
You are becoming aware of your resurrection. And so you return to the place
that corresponds to you, the place that has never been usurped or annulled,
where you continue to dance the majestic dance of creation. There in your
sacred place, within the immeasurable immensity of the universe, you are a
subtle drop of light that shimmers with the rhythm of love, just as atoms dance
to the rhythm of life. There you are an atom of God, a molecule of love. There
you are the immortal soul, particle of divine light.

Beloved divine souls! Do you realize how much joy it brings us to spend time in
union with you? You are our joy. That is why we are burning with the desire to
be together every day, united in this work of Heaven that, with you, we are
putting into words, making a beautiful melody become a song. We are
experiencing being one mind, one being, one soul, one holy love. We, your
angels and your friends from Heaven, thank you for being as God created you to
be and for expressing your love of your Creator by remaining united to us and
to your own being. Remember once more that together we are the Heaven of the
world. United we are the sacred heart.

## III. The Idea of Fear Emerges

Now, within the crystalline drop of water, arising from the ocean of love that
is the spirit of God, emanating from the divine body, within the particle of
light that emanates from the ray of light that emerged from the perpetual sun,
a thought split. A micro droplet cleaved from the pure drop. The thought of
separation was born in the soul. It is as if the micro droplet said, “I am
separate from the drop and the ocean. I am not that ocean. I am me, just me.”
And from the thought of separation the thought of fear emerged, which is
different from a feeling of fear.

The physical universe had not yet been born, nor had the consciousness that
allows fear to be felt and perceived. At this level of creation, a level of
pure abstraction, of pure thought, fear is neutral. It simply followed from the
thought of separation. It was God thinking of being separated from God. Since
God is unlimited, he would not put a limit on the thoughts of a particle of
light. The soul is free within the pure potentiality of God. There was no
reason to limit thought. God did not prevent the idea of fear, still abstract,
from being created by that little part that separated from the pure soul, just
as you cannot prevent your mind from conceiving ideas. The mind is unlimited.

In the pure potentiality of the divine mind a part of this mind could
temporarily separate itself from itself and conceive the idea of being separate
from God—an idea of an autonomous self, of a creative autonomy, of a
self-sufficient being. The idea of a God separated from God was an
unparalleled, daring, creative move, the fruit of the limitless potential of
infinite mind. It arose in the firmament of peace that has no opposite. And in
this way, the joy of eternal creative extension continues, the joy of creating
eternally for God’s simple purpose of extending Himself in the love that He is.
