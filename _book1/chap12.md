## I. The Challenge to Love

Daughters and sons of light that cannot be extinguished! Blessed souls! Try to
remember with a memory that is beyond all time and place. Try to reach memories
as ancestral as eternity itself, memories before time existed, before the
planets existed. Before the wind blew across a barren Earth. Before the sun
embraced the Earth with its light and heat. Before the birds of the sky
embellished the firmament with their flight. Before the lilies of the field
shone in all their glory. Before matter was conceived. Before all that, long
before everything that can be perceived existed, the soul was. It was radiant,
sublime, majestic. Pure light, pure potentiality.

Before all was the soul. The soul was the light of the Father, emanating from
love as a particular extension of true light. In an ineffable movement of pure
love, the source of light became particles of light, and spread eternal truth.
This is how it is: the light of all light in infinite luminescence, in perfect
union, peace, and harmony with its source. There where the pure soul is an
infinite space of infinite love, where only pure potentiality exists, is where
you live. That’s where you live in radiant and eternal peace, soul in love.
There in the silence of peace is where sweetness resides, where tenderness
dwells, where you rest in tranquility, where you are in the eternal reality of
the Father, where you are who you are in truth, where you abide in the presence
of love and are embraced in the light of life.

Everything is possible, nothing is impossible in the pure potentiality of God.
Given this essence of divine nature, it was not impossible that what God is not
could be conceived by the mind of the pure soul, even when God Himself had
extended His I Am to His creation. Fear was not a conception of pure divine
potentiality at its source in God, but was conceived of by the soul as part of
the pure potentiality that God had extended to it. When the soul was created as
an inextinguishable light, it carried in its essence the totality of God.
Therefore nothing was impossible to the soul. The soul was, like the Father,
pure potentiality. It still is and will be forever. The Father could never
limit the soul because He created it as an extension of His unlimited mind. The
pure soul is as unlimited as the pure intelligence that gave rise to it. Not
only is it unlimited, but it is pure creative potentiality, just as God is.

The soul constantly creates by the mere fact of being. The soul is pure
thought, just as life is. As we have already remembered, there is only pure
thought. What happened then? The soul decided by its own free will to create a
will separate from that of its Creator. It asked itself: “What would happen if
I believed in a different way than God believes? What would happen if I created
a universe in which I am autonomous? What would happen if I believe the
opposite of love? If I create the opposite of truth? God has no opposite, but
can I create one? God has no limits, but can I create a limited reality that
imposes limits on love and truth? God is totality but can I create a separate
part of that totality?”

In short, the soul in its pure potentiality freely chose to be different from
what God had determined it would eternally be. The soul decided to create
separation. The soul, or rather the part that split from pure soul, chose
autonomy.

## II. Everything Is Allowed

Once the idea of separation was conceived and accepted, the soul advanced to a
new creative dimension. Movement continued. The soul believed in the truth of
its idea. Creation continued to spread without interruption of any kind from
the creative source that is God. But now more fear than joy was being created.
Then a concatenated series of ideas and thoughts, all in perfect harmony with
the idea of pure fear, followed one upon another. Now the totally fearful
consciousness that is the ego sought to continue its existence, because the
self that had emerged from the idea of separation did what every self does: it
wanted to be. And it sought to achieve that goal logically, for the ego is
logical. Its logic is impeccable, even though it is apart from the truth and
love that is the foundation of reason.

The micro-droplet believed itself to be separate sought to enjoy the “harmony”
that it remembered as pure soul. The ego is creative, coherent, and powerful.
Fear is creative, coherent, and powerful, in the same way as love is, but with
a big difference—a big difference, not a subtle difference. The big difference
is that the power and creativity of fear are illusory. The power and creativity
of love are real.

Fear is contraction, a condensation, and unconsciousness. Love is extension,
immutable conservation, and unlimited consciousness. You may wonder why love is
said to be an extension of infinite power, whereas fear is said to be
contractive and limited. The answer lies in the fact that fear is the opposite
of love. In that essential characteristic of fear—whose primordial origin is
the pure soul—is its weakness.

Now the conditions were in place to create and build, or rather imagine, a
house of cards. A house of fear was erected within the universe of love. At the
moment of the creation of pure spirit—which is a movement without end—space was
conceived, although not as you conceive of it in the realm of time and space.
It was, rather, space as pure abstraction, an unlimited thought, a space where
all thought could exist, a space so vast that it allowed pure potentiality to
be expressed without limits. The perfect knowledge we have—and that now you are
beginning to remember—of that boundless space of pure intelligence is what
has led us to tell you once again: “Sisters and brothers, in the universe there
is enough space for everyone and everything.”

Nothing can limit your mind. Nothing can limit your heart. You are unlimited
always. You can believe what you want to believe. You can feel what you want to
feel. You can extend what you want to extend. You are free, always free. Free
to create your experience. So free that even when you choose not to extend love
you are exercising free will. Sisters and brothers, if you understand it well,
here lies the true meaning of the expression, “Nothing is impossible with God,”
and also the expression, “You always do the will of God.” For the will of the
Father is that you exist eternally within the pure potentiality of love.

Even believing that you can be separated from love is allowed. Do you remember
when you were told that everything is allowed, but that not everything is
convenient? He who spoke those words almost two thousand years ago spoke from
the mind of Christ. Is it surprising to see what happens every moment when you
either create from love or its opposite?

## III. A Time for Fear

Now, remaining in the silence of your hearts, you are in the perfect condition
to observe without judgment how the house of cards was built, to observe the
strength of fear within the realm of love. You can observe the house of shadows
within the abode of light, the palace consecrated to illusion within the
infinity of truth, the house of fear inside the house of truth.

See if you can remember with a mind that goes beyond all time and place. See if
you can bring the imagination to uncreated truth. See if you can let yourself
embrace the totality of love that extends without limit into the eternal
multidimensionality of creation. Open your mind, at least for a few minutes,
while you receive these words. Leave behind all mental limitations, all
preconceptions of a reality so limited, so cold that everything puts on a coat.

Did you really believe that the boundless intelligence that is the divine mind
would only create a reality limited to three dimensions? Did you really believe
that the pure potentiality that is unconditional love could only create a world
of “if this, then that”? Can you begin to remember that God is infinite and
therefore His creation is a multidimensional reality that exists in unlimited
abstraction and pure endless potentiality beyond all understanding?

In silence let yourself be embraced by love. Let the light of truth shine in
you. In peace, remember the tenderness of the love in which you live, the
fullness of self that you are, the reality in which the soul, the spirit, and
God exist in perfect peace and unity. In the stillness of self begin to
remember the pure eternal potentiality of love. Feel the joy of the soul that
lives united to its Creator in the light of eternal truth. Experience now the
ecstasy of the soul that dwells in the unity of spirit with God. Rejoice in the
perpetual happiness of creating forever in love.

The house of cards needed to be “created” in order to give reality to the idea
of fear and separation. In order to be, a space is required. Creation is always
thought because reality is pure thought. Given this, the ego created within
God’s creation a kind of sub-creation: the separated self, an individual, a
personality, an autonomous self.

If a foreign thought of love was conceived and crossed into the Heaven of God,
then the idea of fear could also be created or extended within the divine
creation that stretched without end. So, next to the creation of matter, which
is condensed consciousness, then fear could exist too. There had to be a
world in which fear and love were seen face to face. These opposites were
necessary to make the idea of separation possible. In this sense, the
micro-particle of light—that part of the soul that conceives itself as separate
from its Creator and everything—created a world of fear in its own way. Not the
Earth, but a world that would rule the lives of its inhabitants.

Thus arose identification with body and personality. That psychosomatic self,
the body and individual mind, would live next to another individual self, yet
each isolated from the other: incomplete selves who would seek completion by
themselves, seeking from outside what they lacked within—fractions of
incomplete selves in search of their completion, so that their belief in
separation, which is also a belief in lack, could be justified. That external
world would be the living witness that would constantly remind the ego of its
separation, autonomy, and cruelty.

Thus was born the house of cards that is your world, whose foundation is the
desire to be special. It is a castle that in due time will crumble from the
breath of truth that shows the perfect equality of everything. The ego was
given a kingdom in which to be, a kingdom outside of the paradise of love. And
at the same time it was prevented from accessing the tree of life—it cannot be
eternal because it has denied the truth.

## IV. The Battlefield

Everything born in time disappears in time. Time was created to give time for
the experience of separation. Everything conceived by the ego is temporary
because it is an idea of limitation. In this way God, in His perfect
intelligence, accepted the idea of separation, the idea of fear, the ego,
without violating freedom or truth. The ego is simply an option. Fear is a
choice, as is love. Neither of these options is sinful. They are simply
options.

Because it was desired to make separation real—which in reality is impossible
because it is impossible to create an opposite to love—a temporary world was
created in which separation seemed to be true. This experience is strictly
temporary. The ego wanted to create the experience of being autonomous and
separate from God, so a world of opposites was created within the matrix of
pure potentiality—the world of good and evil, the world of love and fear, not
in created reality but in the dream of forgetting the self. Now Adam—the
molecule from which everything arose in the universe of matter, the particle of
the soul that, having split, created multiplicity—fell into a dream. The dream
of forgetting God, the amnesia of the soul, began. The soul fell asleep in the
arms of the God of life. It began to dream a dream of its own creation. It
began to create a nightmare of a world separate from the self, a world of fear,
and limitation, a world without love, imagining that it was God and creating
without God. For this to happen it has to first or simultaneously create a
condensation that allowed it to entertain a limitation of lack and death. That
is the body.

The body is where the ego lives in the house of cards. It is the perfect
creation of the ego. In itself the body is perfect because it is the medium
that allows you to perceive the full range of human experience in time and
space. Just as an actor is the perfect medium for a play, the body is the
perfect medium to represent separation.. This is how the tragedy was born, of
the man who believes he is a body and lives inside it. He is trapped in a house
of cards. He does not want to recognize that it simply is not true. It is true
for him.
