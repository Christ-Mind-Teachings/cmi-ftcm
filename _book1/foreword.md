> The Christ has need of helpers in the world of form <br>
and separation. Each one brings a Light that shines away <br>
all darkness. Each one bears a message of Love and hope, <br>
of resurrection and the end of death’s harsh rule. <br>
You’re the One. You’re the one He needs. <br>
Without you, there is no salvation.

##  Foreword
{: .ui.header.center.aligned}

The teaching presented in these pages is the result of a collaboration between
the Mind of Jesus of Nazareth and myself. This teaching, to put it simply and
directly, has been scribed. The content, the ideas, as well as the form in
which they are expressed, have been received directly from the Mind of Jesus
and written down as they were received. The content has not been altered or
changed in any way. The original form of expression has been preserved with
only minor changes. Throughout the transcription of this material, there has
been a careful process of editing to ensure clarity and ease of expression. 

I have made every effort not to interfere with His transmission, to receive it
as clearly and directly as possible, and to record it literally as I have
received it. 

The process of transmission and reception was simple and direct. In full
conscious awareness, in a relaxed and receptive state of mind, I would receive
the first words or phrase of a sentence through a kind of inner hearing. As I
wrote them down, more words would come until the sentence was complete. Then
the next sentence would begin. I never knew at the beginning of a sentence, how
it would end. 

In 1984, I began working with the profound teaching that is *A Course in
Miracles*. By 1985, I began to hear the still, small voice of Spirit, the Voice
for God, that is described in the Course as the Holy Spirit. I have done my
best to follow the guidance I receive from Him ever since. From time to 
time, I would have the experience that Jesus was speaking to me also.

Then in January of this year, 2012, I began to experience a deepening and
continuous communication with the Mind of Jesus. Much to my surprise, He asked
me to take dictation, to write down a teaching He would give me that was to be
published in book form. In addition to providing the material for this book,
Jesus has guided me through every step of the process, from start to finish.
Everything necessary for the publication of this book was miraculously provided
when and as needed. This whole project has been a miracle, every step of the
way. To have been part of it has been a great blessing. For that I thank Jesus,
the Holy Spirit, my Heavenly Father, and all my brothers who have helped me
along the way. 

This teaching is intended to be a kind of later day supplement to *A Course in
Miracles*. Indeed, at times even the language of the Course itself is used. This
teaching is presented as an additional explanation and exposition of some of
the main ideas presented in the Course. It also contains some material not
found in the Course, material reminiscent of the spiritual teachings of other
versions of the universal curriculum such as Advaita Vedanta and Buddhism. 

My sincere wish is that this teaching be helpful to students of *A Course in
Miracles*, aiding their study, understanding, and application of the principles
of the Course, and helping them awaken to the Christ, the Self, Who is their
true identity. For readers who are not actively working with the Course at this
time, may you be inspired to begin this work, if you are so guided. In any
case, may all find within these pages much that is helpful and useful to them
on their spiritual journey. 

Any errors of content or expression of this material are mine and mine only.
For that, I ask the reader’s forbearance and forgiveness. 

May God bless you and keep you, and I pray that you may soon find your way
Home. Thank you. Thank you, Father.
