Beloved soul, I have come as the living Christ who lives in you. I have come to
claim my inheritance. I have come to claim your soul. I have come to remind
you—soul in love, and the many who receive these words of wisdom and love—of
the path to happiness and fulfillment. The way is to love everything that
arises within you, everything that you perceive, and everything that you
experience inside.

Your function is to bless creation. In other words, it is to bring love to
everything that arises within the framework of your consciousness, be it
images, feelings, memories, emotions, thoughts, sensations, things, bodies,
circumstances, or events. All.

Beloved soul, \
I am the living Christ who lives in you. \
I am the faithful reflection of your self, of your soul. \
I am the pearl of inestimable value. \
I am the lost drachma. \
I am the hidden treasure. \
I am what you have forgotten precisely because it is true. \
I am the light of Christ Consciousness. \
I am your true identity. \
I am what you are in truth. \
I am the Christ in you.

The whiteness of the light in which I have come is a pale reflection of the
ineffable glory and power that live in you—you are light of the true light.

I am the perfect reflection of your Self.

I am the abode of light.

I do not come to you at any time without your volitional participation. I never
break into your lives in an untimely way. I am always at the door and calling.
When you are ready to open your mind and your heart, making a serene space for
Me, then without delay I make myself present. I manifest myself in all my glory
and splendor, glory and splendor that is also yours because I do not have
anything left for myself. I do not listen or follow the greedy call because I
do not have or harbor any fear.

I am pure love.

I am pure potentiality.

I am pure intelligence.

I am your soul, radiant, unlimited, perfect.

I am the abode of light.

A single thought of love is enough for Me to make an appearance in your life
and embrace you in the light, warmth, and solace of my love. I love everything
that arises in Me and you are precisely that which has arisen from my divinity,
from my Self of infinite Love. You are my perfect creation. You are that part
of Me that only you can be. You are a piece of Heaven. A particle of love. You
are a molecule of the God that I am. You are my light, my beloved, my truth.

There is no place where I am not.

Where the wind blows, there I am.

Where the breeze of a spring sunset embraces everything, there I am.

Where the dew kisses the grass, there I am.

Where the perfume of the spikenard is scattered by the beauty of its flower,
there I am.

Where a star is born, there I am.

Where there is a heart broken and a tear springs, there I am.

Where the sweetness dwells, there I am.

Where there is tenderness, there I am.

Where the waters of Heaven meet those of the Earth creating unfathomable
oceans, there I am.

Where a thought of fear rises over the horizon, there I am.

Where there is a flower, there I am with all my love.

Where you are, there I am because you are my light, my beloved and my all.

There is no place where I am not.

There is no place where you and I are not forever united in the light of truth.

There, where the ray of light that emerges from the sun illuminates, there we
are together, you and me.

Where the petal of a rose falls, there we are together, you and me, because we
are that which has been given life, everything that the eyes see and beyond.

We are the pure potentiality of love. We are the abode of light.
