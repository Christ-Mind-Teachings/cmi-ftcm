Below are the prayers mentioned in Manifestation 6, “Devotion: Union of the Three Hearts.”

## The Song of Mary (Magnificat)

My soul doth magnify the Lord, and my spirit hath rejoiced in God my Saviour.

For He hath regarded the lowliness of His handmaiden. For behold, from henceforth all generations shall call
me blessed.

And His mercy is on them that fear Him throughout
all generations.

He hath shown strength with His arm.

He hath scattered the proud in the imagination of
their hearts.

He hath put down the mighty from their seat and hath exalted the humble and meek.

He hath filled the hungry with good things.

And the rich He hath sent empty away.

He remembering His mercy hath helped His servant Israel as He promised to our
forefathers Abraham, and his seed forever. Amen.

2. __Repeat the Our Father:__ *Our Father, Who art in Heaven, hallowed be Thy name; Thy Kingdom come; Thy will be done on Earth as it is in Heaven. Give us this day our daily bread; and forgive us our trespasses as we forgive those who trespass against us; and lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from evil, Amen.*

3. __Repeat the Hail Mary:__ *Hail Mary, full of grace. The Lord is with thee. Blessed art thou amongst women, and blessed is the fruit of thy womb, Jesus. Holy Mary, Mother of God, pray for us sinners, now and at the hour of our death, Amen.*

4. __Repeat the apostles’ creed:__ *I believe in God, the Father almighty, Creator of Heaven and Earth, and in Jesus Christ, His only Son, our Lord, who was conceived by the Holy Spirit, born of the Virgin Mary, suffered under Pontius Pilate, was crucified, died and was buried; He descended into hell; on the third day He rose again from the dead; He ascended into Heaven, and is seated at the right hand of God the Father almighty; from there He will come to judge the living and the dead. I believe in the Holy Spirit, the holy Catholic Church, the communion of saints, the forgiveness of sins, the resurrection of the body, and life everlasting. Amen.*
