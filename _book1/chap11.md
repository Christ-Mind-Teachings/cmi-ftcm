I. Unconsciousness

Beloveds of God, lights that shine forever! Pure souls! We have come together
in the consciousness of Christ in which lives all that is real. We come with
gratitude, joy, and love. We come as the pure discernment that we are. We thank
you once again for allowing us to dwell among you. We thank you for opening
your hearts to the flow of divine union through which these words of light and
purity flow. Value and honor the gift of these words, but above all realize
that these dialogues occur in a mind united in the fullness of love, in one
mind. These dialogues happen between you, the reader, and us. They are unique
because you are unique and your response is unique. Heaven is calling you in
answer to your call.

Creation will be explained in different phases as if it had occurred at various
levels: seven days of creation, seven phases, seven levels, seven movements.
This story—widespread in your separated minds—symbolically represents the
different dimensions of creation. We have, so far, walked together through the
story of the creation of pure spirit, pure soul, and the emergence of
separation and fear as ideas that split from the spark of light that is the
pure soul that sought to be a separate, autonomous self.

But history does not end here because the history of creation is eternal. And
now the movement of eternal creation took another step. That part of the soul
that split continued to condense or descend. The particles of light that
emerged from the soul condensed to the point of creating matter. The physical
world emerged. What you call life began. Necessary conditions were provided.
Life in matter flowed from pure potentiality and perfect creative intelligence
in what we might call a movement of condensation to become a wide variety of
forms.

As the creative flow deployed, taking shape in matter, creativity was also
increasingly expressed through the energy of fear. We have deliberately used
the expression “energy” because we want to remind you that fear as an idea is
simply energy, so is neutral, as is the energy behind the idea of every
emotion. Keep this memory in your hearts: the idea of fear is energy just as
the ideas of love, sadness, joy, or compassion are energy. Everything is
energy in the sense that everything is pure thought or consciousness. Life is
consciousness.

If the idea of fear is neutral, how then can it be the cause of a whole world?
You must understand that there is a difference between the uncreated truth of
love and that which you call love. The latter is not actually pure thought but
an emotion expressed in the body. The feeling of fear is also an emotion
expressed in the body. What many of you call “love” is a distorted reflection
of perfect love. While “love” has its source in pure love—it still is not pure
love because it is not devoid of fear. Love is the reality of what you are. It
is the supreme reality of self. Love is not a feeling. Love is what you are.
Love is God.

Fear is also an emotion, and therefore not part of the reality of the divine
self who is pure love. How is it that one could give life to a world based on
fear? Only through the existence of distorted perception. That perception is
distorted by the ego’s self-involvement. This is where the highest degree of
condensation or unconsciousness occurred, because the consciousness of ego is
completely based on fear. In other words, ego is fear, even though its source
is pure potentiality, unlimited creativity.

God does not limit. He is incapable of creating limitation. Therefore He does
not limit the ego’s creative power. All the creative power of Heaven and Earth
is within the grasp of the ego. You are daily witnesses to how active, and
incessantly creative, is the ego mind. You are witnesses to how in the
twinkling of an eye the ego can change its mind and create new perceptions
about anything. In a single instant the ego is able to change the relative
perception of what it perceives with great ease and creative dynamism. The ego
never rests.

## II. Amnesia of the Self

That the ego has power and that it is creative cannot be doubted. As we have
already mentioned, this is because, in its origin, the ego comes from the pure
potential of the soul. Therefore, as with all creative selves, the ego seeks to
create. Yet what it creates is a separate and autonomous existence, based on
its own confused image and likeness. It seeks to create permanence for itself.
In this way, it acts similarly to when a cancerous cell decides to grow and
function in its own way, disconnected from the laws of the rest of the body.
Cancer cells act as if they no longer depend on the body that keeps them
healthy and safe. Similarly, the ego’s fear creates disease in the body.

The ego’s distorted, self-involved consciousness decides to blindly attack
creation. It is the decision of a part of the soul to create in its own limited
image instead of extending the image of the Creator and thus living in harmony
with the laws of love. We could say that the ego is an unwise decision or error
because it seeks to achieve an unattainable purpose. It is an idea that is
unhinged from the divine reality of love. Ego is an attack on love.

The idea of attack and loneliness is born of ego-consciousness, and with it
the idea of death, because they are the same. We could say that a state of
consciousness is born that allows the ego to know itself as a being that is
alone and independent, a contracted self that does not wish to obey the laws of
God.

The ego, in its creative potential, seeks to create a solitary reality—a
reality in which each individual must cope by himself or herself to understand
a world that neither loves, nor protects, nor can be understood, a world in
which everyone lives alone, among other solitary selves who, like it, dedicate
themselves to fighting each other and everything, a world in which everything
has a desire to survive, despite knowing that death, which is the only
certainty of that reality, will lead them to total and absolute separation by
making them nothing. And all this is for the sole purpose of being able to sing
a victory song of triumph over God. Thus the ego-consciousness seeks to create
a solitary reality in which it lives without any real connection with anything,
with the idea that an autonomous being can be real. For this to have been
possible it was necessary to create the idea that God is an illusion. Yet only
in illusion, only in a world of childish fantasies, could the reality of a
solitary state be achievable. And that is what ego created: the great illusion
of the world.

This is how condensation reached its zenith, its maximum expression. This is
how fear, or ego-consciousness, took final form. Unconsciousness arose: a state
of amnesia in which the self forgot its soul, spirit, and God. An impossible
state. A state in which God became unknown to Himself. Adam’s dream was born.
