title: Epilogue
---

I thank you my brother, for your Love and dedication to Truth. God waits for
our return, the gate is always open. Yet only you can determine when you will
walk through it. Time waits only on your decision, for your return Home is
certain. You cannot fail to do your Father’s Will, to be what you are in Truth.
His Will is done on earth as It is in Heaven.  

Now your eyes are beginning to open, as the Christ Light within you is shining
once again. The memory of Truth rises to your awareness, dispelling the
darkness, ending the long, weary night of ignorance. The Spiritual Sun is
rising in the east, Its bright rays warming the earth and everywhere you look
you see a new world, a world ruled by peace and justice, where Love and
kindness are shared by all. All that is given is returned many times over, for
God’s laws prevail, even in the dream, for those who abandon themselves to
Love.  

Only what is true and good will enter your holy mind. And goodness and mercy
will follow you all the days of your life, until you return to dwell in the
House of the Lord forever.
