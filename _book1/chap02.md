## I. Where Are Thoughts Born?

Let ́s see if you can immerse yourself in divine memory. To continue to live as
if the thinking mind were the whole makes no sense. Expand your consciousness.
Leave that tiny bit behind and begin to let consciousness expand to encompass
everything. Begin to see with the eyes of the soul.

Let us begin to know with that part of the self that is beyond the thinking
mind, that both informs and is informed. Leave all judgment aside. Don’t judge
what you’ll see or what you’ll hear because you’ll see what no human eye ever
saw and hear what no human ear has ever heard and never will hear. You will see
and hear what no one will ever hear or see for you. Only you can see who you
are in truth. It is something no one will be able to tell you, and you will not
be able to tell it to others. What is beyond the thinking mind has to be
experienced to be known.

Where are thoughts born? Where do they reside? Who or what gives them
existence? Who thinks what thoughts think?  Where does sweetness reside? Where
does life live? Where does love dwell?

Every thought must have an origin, a place that might be called the cradle of
thought. We return to the consciousness of Self, the center that we really are.
Follow the wake of consciousness, not the content of thought but the energy,
the feeling of thought—and leave the body behind. Don’t cling to the idea of
the physical body. Begin to feel that part of the universe from where thoughts
flow. Feel the myriad of thoughts flowing in profusion, coming and going from
one side to the other as if an energetic force sprouts from a center and
extends outward from itself, like a volcano from whose nucleus in the center of
the Earth its heat and its force are thrown outward irresistibly, an explosion
of vitality that emanates from the nucleus. That nucleus is a source, an Alpha.

Where are thoughts born? Let your ancient memory be free to go wherever it
wants, and let remembrance come to you by itself. This ancient memory knows who
created it and its value. It knows where love resides and it is there, to the
refuge of divine love, where it will go in search of its safety and its peace.
It knows the way. Allow it to live in the Father’s house undisturbed.

## II. The Window of Consciousness

There is a place in the universe from which all thought emanates. Thought—not
to be confused with the act of thinking—is an effect of divine origin. Anyone
who observes thought can know this in a simple, clear way. Thought is a means,
never an end. It cannot be an end because thought is not of its own origin.
Thought doesn’t create itself. Clearly there is something that precedes
thought. That “something” is precisely what we are talking about. Is it a
place? Is it just one place? Or is there a place for each person? Why do you
each have different thoughts? Is each person an independent source? Are you
source in yourself? An individual source that creates its own thoughts—the
thoughts you think you think—in itself and by itself? On what basis did you
conceive them? If each were a closed system in itself that creates its own
thinking unattached to other closed systems of thought, what holds these
separate systems together? Where does each individual system get the vital
energy that is the source of thought? Are each of you an independent volcano
with an autonomous nucleus from which you expand outward?

If you rest in stillness and close your eyes for an instant and suspend
judgment, you will see a series of thoughts pass in front of you. This is
nothing surprising. It is what it is. You call it observation or witnessing.
What happened? Certain thoughts have gone through your mind. In other words,
your consciousness is like a window through which you are looking. Everything
that goes in front of that window is seen. What doesn’t go in front of that
window doesn’t seem to exist. If your consciousness is like the window of a
house and you are locked inside the house looking out, then everything you
observe is limited. You are not seeing the whole because you cannot see all the
relationships that exist. The farther you move away from the window, the less
you see outside. The closer you are, the more you see. Who thinks thoughts?
What is the relationship between you and that something that thinks what you
think? Where do these thoughts— that which is seen through the window—come
from?

## III. Imagination and True Thought

Daughters and sons of purity and truth, those are not true thoughts. When you
sit alone inside the house and contemplate through that window, you are seated
in the house of a dream, dreaming a life, imagining you’re thinking, giving
pictures to everything, creating dream images. Although they are the result of
an activity of the mind, these are not true thoughts; they are imaginations
that come from sleep, from the dream of oblivion. Outside the house is life.
Outside the house is the truth about you and everything. We said that if you
are near to the window you can see more. What would happen if you go through
the window and venture beyond it? What would life look like from outside the
house?

Go out and rejoice in your glory. To reach the desires of your heart is what we
encourage you to do. Going out of the house of fear is what leads you to throw
yourself into love.

Children of love, you are sitting inside a house from whose window you observe
life without getting involved in it. You are being the created but not a
creator. That means your mental activity is not actually thinking about
anything true. This means that you have renounced your power to create. Life is
thought because true thought is the means through which everything is created.
If you have no true thought about anything, you stop creating. If you have no
true thought you stop being who you are, in the sense that you stop expressing
yourself. If you stop expressing yourself, you lose the consciousness of what
you are in truth, which generates a sense of smallness, vulnerability, and
wrongness that makes you feel less and fewer.

The time has come to get out of the chrysalis. The time has come to remember
again, and thus recognize, that the cradle of thought is the Heart of God. When
we return and keep within the refuge of divine love that is God Himself, in the
undivided union of the three hearts. Then all thought of God will be true
thought in your mind and you will leave forever the limited gaze that arises
from seeing everything from the perspective of the senses of the body.

## IV. To Think and To Be

We leave the body behind. We observe it with kindness and compassion. We begin
to take distance from form and understand that shape mimics content. All loving
thought of God is expressed in a rose, in a beam of light, the clink of the
crystalline water droplets that splash in a pond where the birds stop to bathe
and drink. We begin to see from beyond the window. We begin to discover. We’re
out of the house of fear. We venture into the unknown. We begin to discover
that all true thought is of God because He and only He can create thought. We
remember. We remember where sweetness resides, where love dwells, where truth
lies. And then we remember that we rose sweetly, looked through the window,
opened it, passed through it and went into the infinity of creation for the joy
of our souls. We no longer look at creation from a passive place without
relating to it or anyone else. Now we remember that the truth is revealed to us
in the relationship of the three hearts. We no longer waste time trying to know
ourselves, God, and life; we know in the only way that can ever be known, in
solitude.

Now we are the observer, the observed, and the relationship between them. We
are the creator, the created, and the relationship between them. We are one
and triune. Now we recognize with happy astonishment that what was happening
was nothing but this: our self was searching to know itself and looked at all
things without realizing that it was in a direct relationship with God, source
of all things, cradle of thought, the whole of everything, where we would know
ourselves because all true knowledge comes from union and relationship. Now we
recognize that we are the cradle of thought and are also the relationship
between the mind that thinks what it thinks and the thought that is thought.
This relationship is consciousness itself because it is what allows the
relationship between the observed and the observer to exist, between the
thought and the thinker.

Now the Self who is the son of truth that is always true says joyfully: I think
as I think because I am who I am. I am the cradle of my thought. I am the one
who thinks what he thinks. If I am one with God my thought will also be one
with Him. If I am one with love, my thought will also be love, because of what
I am. Thus, children of the Most High, claim your power in creation and return
to the refuge of love recognizing that you and only you are the cradle of your
thoughts in the same way that God and God alone is the cradle of all truth.
