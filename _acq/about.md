This teaching is intended to be a kind of later day supplement to *A Course in
Miracles*. Indeed, at times even the language of the Course itself is used. This
teaching is presented as an additional explanation and exposition of the main
ideas presented in the Course. It also contains some material not found in the
Course, material reminiscent of the spiritual teachings of other versions of
the universal curriculum such as Advaita Vedanta and Buddhism. 

Only a quiet mind, resting in the present, can encounter Truth. The purpose of
spiritual discipline, of mind training, is to achieve just that quietness and
stability of mind in which Spirit reveals Itself as you.

The Holy Spirit teaches Love, and reinforces this learning in your mind, while
helping you recognize everything in your mind that is not Love. Through the
Light of your Mind, you see the Light in your brother, and in that Light is
your Oneness made manifest. The Light in you is what the world longs to behold,
for it shines away all darkness. Let the mind go a little farther on the path
towards Truth, and the Light shines brighter as the darkness begins to lift. 

Whatever you do, do it with Love. Forgiveness frees your mind, allowing its Light
to shine brightly. The mind of forgiveness shines its gentle Light on all
without exception. Every step closer to Truth and the Light shines more,
illuminating the path before you, guiding you Home. 

Salvationâ€™s goal is this return of Truth to your mind, and reunion with the
Self. Whether you are aware of It or not, your Self abides in shining silence,
at One with Its Creator, fulfilling the function of creating given in Its
Creation by God.
