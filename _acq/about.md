This teaching is intended to be a kind of later day supplement to *A Course in
Miracles*. Indeed, at times even the language of the Course itself is used. This
teaching is presented as an additional explanation and exposition of the main
ideas presented in the Course. It also contains some material not found in the
Course, material reminiscent of the spiritual teachings of other versions of
the universal curriculum such as Advaita Vedanta and Buddhism. 

Whenever is the time, and wherever you are is the place to find Truth. Truth is
not somewhere else far away, a something that must be diligently sought. It is
closer to you than your own heartbeat. There is no distance that separates you
from the Truth at this very moment.

What you do with your mind is all-important, for life is of the mind; even in
this world your life takes place in consciousness. 

Only a quiet mind, resting in the present, can encounter Truth. The purpose of
spiritual discipline, of mind training, is to achieve just that quietness and
stability of mind in which Spirit reveals Itself as you.

The Holy Spirit teaches Love, and reinforces this learning in your mind, while
helping you recognize everything in your mind that is not Love. Through the
Light of your Mind, you see the Light in your brother, and in that Light is
your Oneness made manifest. The Light in you is what the world longs to behold,
for it shines away all darkness. Let the mind go a little farther on the path
towards Truth, and the Light shines brighter as the darkness begins to lift. 

Whatever you do, do with Love. Forgiveness frees your mind, allowing its Light
to shine brightly. The mind of forgiveness shines its gentle Light on all
without exception. Every step closer to Truth and the Light shines more,
illuminating the path before you, guiding you Home. 

Salvationâ€™s goal is this return of Truth to your mind, and <span
class="under">reunion</span> with the Self. Whether you are aware of It or not,
your Self abides in shining silence, at One with Its Creator, fulfilling the
function of creating given in Its Creation by God.

You will return to your Father when you no longer fear Him. The fear of God
lies deep within every mind, waiting for the day it is uncovered, recognized as
complete madness, and healed. God's Love sustains you in all you do, even now.
To fear the One Who created you by giving you His Being, His Mind, His Light
and Love, is an error beyond comprehension. Yet this error cannot be reasoned
away. It must be faced, recognized for what it is, and dispelled with the help
of the Holy Spirit. The mind created by God must return to full awareness of
its Oneness with its Creator.

When you finally hear the call of your Soul, you must answer it. Its call
cannot be ignored, for it is the call of your Heart to your heart. When the
Heart calls to you, you will recognize it as the call of Love to love. Love can
be ignored; It can be denied; you can dissociate yourself from It; but It will
never cease to call out to you, for It knows you as Itself.
