## I. Prelude

Beloved pure soul, betrothed of the living Christ, love that God is! Today we
have come, once again, as the countless children of the Creator that we are. We
have come by the will of the Father to speak to you and to all souls who in one
way or another receive the words of love and wisdom of this blessed work. You
souls are in the design who by your openness of heart welcome this
manifestation of Heaven. From all eternity you have been conceived by divine
wisdom as part of a supreme plan. We have come to address you today by means of
a helping hand who, as a scribe of Heaven, becomes the channel of our angelic
voice and serves the cause and effect of heavenly love.

Thank you for listening to the voice of Christ, the voice that speaks in all
hearts thirsting for love and truth. Christ is love. Only the true love of
Christ is Heaven. You who are the betrothed of Christ, remember always that the
Father has given us a message for each of you who are part of this work, either
by reading, lovingly listening, or by sharing your experience and giving
expression to the love and beauty of God. We also speak to the many who
unknowingly receive the love that flows from us to them through this channel of
grace. They are minds that in one way or another seek the truth, hearts that
sincerely yearn for peace, love, and concord.

Beloveds of God, remember that the word of the Most High is the word of eternal
life. It is a living, life-giving word. It always achieves its purpose. And
since it comes from everlasting wisdom, the pure love that you call Abba,
Father, God, or Creator, it is unlimited. It is not subject to time or space.
Thus the voice of love always reaches where it needs to go. The word of God is
like the wind: you know not from where it comes or where it goes, but it blows.
The wind of love always blows, refreshing arid hearts and removing the debris
that conceals the soul’s light of truth.

Holy ones, we have come in response to the call from you who have asked for a
spiritual practice. In the past you have immersed yourselves in the grace of
prayer and contemplation. Know now that we are no longer on the path of effort,
action, sacrifice, or rituals of form. You no longer need exercises. Now you
are in the time of living the truth that you are, in the time of being, in the
time of the joy of love. This is the time of Mary, a time of harvest, in which
you, the sowers, return singing as you bring in the sheaves, a time of
remaining in the radiant presence of the truth that is the supreme end of
reason. However, since you have asked for a practice, it will be given, just as
you who asked for a path of devotion and prayer have been given the devotion to
the union of three hearts. A single practice is all that we offer for you who
are the spouse of perfect love, who already live in truth.

Remember: while truth is always true, not everyone comes to it at the same
time. It is always advisable that even though a practice is no longer
necessary, or even inappropriate, still it may be used until the perfect time
for you to release it. Meanwhile, God attends to this particular desire of your
soul. Therefore, enjoy the ineffable gift that Heaven gives you in this
spiritual
exercise, which, if understood in spirit and truth, contains within itself all true practices of love of the Creator that help us to live in union with the totality of God.

## II. An Exercise In Union

Be still now. Leave the world outside. Leave aside all your worries, if you
still perceive any. Let all your beliefs go serenely. Immerse yourself in you
and in the immeasurable vastness of your soul. Call with all the love of your
heart:

> Jesus, Jesus, Jesus, \
> Husband of my soul.

Say the name three times. Call him what he really is for you: blessed husband
of your soul. Feel the name resonate throughout the universe. Become aware of
how creation is silent in perfect reverence before the love of loves when you,
the betrothed, pronounce the name of your divine spouse. Say the name of the
beloved of your soul, then be silent. In peace remember that Jesus is the name
of the humanized Christ, God made man, your brother, your husband, your divine
savior.

Immerse yourself in expectation. Observe all creation as imbued in sacred
silence, in the ecstasy of love, truth, and contemplation, in the presence of
the husband of love. Feel the union of your heart with the sacred heart of
Jesus. Join him. Stay with your beloved. Stay in love. Fulfill yourself in
this. Tell him how much you love him, then return to silence. Let love do what
it does.

After having met with Jesus in his most sacred heart, pronounce the name of the
mother of the living, who is also your blessed mother. Say to yourself:

> Mary, Mary, Mary, \
> Mother of God and my mother.

Link your heart with the Immaculate Heart of Mary and become a single being in
union with the mother of love and with Jesus. Become one heart with the divine
essence. Get lost in Mary. Feel the embrace of tenderness. Feel the warmth of
motherhood that springs from your insides and imbibes your whole being. Feel
the sweetness of Mary. Abide in the purity of your heart. Be silent, and drink
from the fountain of eternal life that springs from the Immaculate Heart. Now,
join your soul to Jesus and Mary. Let Christ express himself as what you are,
here and now. Enjoy yourself in the presence of love.

Beloved soul, follow God’s voice. Regardless of what you believe about Jesus or
Mary, even if you knew nothing of the greatness of their divine hearts, simply
pronounce the names and receive in the depths of your heart the grace of being
aware of your union with all that is true. Your soul knows of what we speak.
The soul sings, dances, and vibrates upon hearing names of love.

Do this exercise every day if necessary. Cast yourself confidently into the
arms of love. Stay in this divine union, the refuge of your soul. Your mind
will find the solace and security it seeks in the center of the heart of Jesus
and Mary. Your heart will find the calmness, peace, and serenity of spirit for
which it longs. Embark with the nectar of pure divine truth that emanates from
this union of perfect love. Inhale the beauty of the holy perfume that springs
from this sacred union. Become one with the whole. Stay in the presence of
love, now and always.

## III. A New Alliance

Sisters and brothers in Christ! Now that you know how to reunite with the
totality of the love that you truly are, and now that you know that you do not
need any spiritual exercises—except the ones that keep you united to the love
that you are—you are perfectly ready to receive this message of love from
Heaven. We have come to form with you a new alliance, which is within the great
alliance that Mary has made with you, or rather that God Himself has made with
you and whose perfect expression is the love of Mary.

Beloveds of God, this is a message from your Heavenly Mother, brought from the
dimension of no-time by our angelic hands and magnificently proclaimed in the
voice of our celestial choir. We give it with all the love of our hearts, with
all the love of the Mother and the Sacred Heart of Jesus, in whose essence
everything that is true exists, including you. Please receive this gift with
love and humble gratitude, aware of how much God loves you and how much love
for you manifests through Mary and Jesus.

Yes, beloveds of the Father, we have come to seal a perfect alliance with you
for you to become aware of the covenant of your hearts with eternal love. You
and your Creator have a perpetual alliance of pure love. What is a betrothal
but an alliance? Do you not use a ring as a symbol of a marriage alliance? We
do it in the name of God, that is, in the name of love. This is a covenant of
love between you and God, a renewed pact that today will be sealed forever.
This covenant reflects the beauty of your heart united with the greatness of
the heart of Jesus. This covenant already exists; today it comes to awareness.
It is a pact between you and your being, between you and truth, a covenant
never to separate yourself again, even for a moment, from the love of God, just
as He never separated, nor will ever separate, from you.

Both of you are now linked with bonds of love and light, united for eternity.
In this covenant, God Himself warrants: my beloved, blessed soul that came out
of my being, we are no longer two but one flesh, one spirit, one truth, one
identity, one holy love. We are the perfect union of truth. We are the oneness
of love. We are eternally one, husband and wife, lover and beloved. We are two
faces of a single truth—the face of love and the face of holiness. We are a
perpetual alliance of love. We are one, the created and the Creator. We
mutually accept the absolute, irreplaceable, indissoluble dependence of God on
you and your being on Him. God Himself has now become fully dependent on your
trust and your love.

In the silence of love from the depths of our hearts we listen with joy and
sacred veneration to what the Father says to the Son, what the husband says to
the spouse. God speaks with the soul. Hear now, in silence, the voice of love
speaking to love.

<div markdown="1" class="indent">

*The voice of God the Father*: “My love! Soul that has sprung from My love,
self of My Self, ineffable beauty! One day you wandered through strange lands.
That day, seven swords pierced the heart of this faithful beloved. From that
day I waited for you with a flaming desire of love. I looked for you throughout
Heaven and Earth. I placed myself on a hill so you could see Me. In the glory
of My resurrection as Jesus I called to you. I made portents and gave signs in
many times and places so you could not fail to see, to bring you back to My
arms. I sang you love songs so you would not forget Me. I sent My messengers to
remind you of the love that unites us. In the bed of Heaven that I prepared for
you from eternity, I waited. I prepared a mansion for you who are on the throne
of My divine heart. In this mansion of Heaven I will treat you with the most
delicious delicacies, delicacies that sprout from the delight of My heart.

“Oh, beloved of My Self, ecstasy of a God who is infinite love! You are the
delight of My heart. You are the beauty of Heaven in which creation recreates
itself. You are the love of My life. Oh, beloved soul! From the day I saw you
leave, My heart sang a plea of love that said: Come back, come home My child!
Come back to My arms, My beloved!

“Pure soul, beauty that has sprung from My holiness! One day you went to wander
through strange lands. You left Me terminally ill in the desert of your
absence, a father without a child, husband without a wife. All light became
darkness. All music from Heaven was silent. I was bereft. Oh, beloved child,
love of My Self! If you could imagine the pain that My divine heart felt upon
seeing you depart, you would cease to exist. Oh, beloved! How much pain to have
you separated from Me! Such pain of your absence can never be assessed. But
child of My love, now that you have returned, which for all eternity I knew
must happen—because I am your Father and Creator and I know the heart of My
child—now that you have returned of your own will, My happiness has no
comparison.

“What love can be greater than love that chooses to love eternally, purely, in
truth and freedom? Just as seven swords crossed My heart when you left, an
infinite universe of endless joy arose when I saw you return—a happiness that
can never wane because it comes from the perfect certainty that we will now
remain together eternally. The joy of eternal reunion abolishes all trace of
pain. Your return multiplies joy and love. Great is the feast of Heaven for
your return! Great is My inextinguishable happiness. Even though the love of
a child inside a mother’s womb is worthy of praise and joy, more joyful is the
love of the child who, though free not to love, nevertheless chooses to love
her with all their soul, with all their heart, and with all their self. Oh, My
child! You are the joy of your Father. You are the triumph of love.”

*The response of the Soul*: “My love, Father of Heaven and of everything
created, Beloved of my soul, I am here. I am back. I have returned. I returned
not by myself but was brought by You in Your own arms. You searched for me. You
found me. You loved me first. You brought me back to the nuptial bed of Heaven
that is Your heart. You, my Father, my Beloved, You and only You have found
what was lost. You saved me from eternal nothingness. You who are infinite
compassion took pity on this lost soul who, without the warmth of Your love,
would have passed through all eternity in the desert, thirsty for truth, in
frozen lovelessness.

“You, faithful Beloved, have brought me back. And by the grace of Your kindness
and mercy, I will be able to sing forever to the glory and purity of Your love.
I have returned to Your arms, brought by Your love, to remain forever attached
by Your side. Oh, my Beloved! Now I will sing eternally, with Your angels, the
divine melodies that spring from the hearts that have become one with Your
divine heart. Oh, my soul’s Beloved! Hold me to You for all eternity. Do not
let me ever separate from You so that I can enjoy eternity in Your company.”

</div>

In union with your soul all Heaven now says “Amen.”

This sacred dialogue resonates throughout the universe. The perpetual covenant
between your being and your true God-Self is sealed with this dialogue of
perfect love. Your being and God have consciously become one for all eternity,
a willful act of divine and human natures. Both natures have united for eter-
nity. The alliance is sealed in a deliberate act of your free will, an act of
free choice to which every soul is called. It is an act that you, individually,
do in the name of all souls here and now because you have become a channel for
the reunion of souls. You gather what was dispersed. You open a new portal
between Heaven and Earth through which the miracle of divine love flows and
extends. Anyone wishing to drink from this sacred source will be forever
satisfied.

## IV. Channels of the Light

Sons and daughters of the reunion of Heaven! Souls who by your own will, joined
with the will of God, have returned to the Father’s house! You who welcome
these words with love, this is the revelation being given to you now: You have
been chosen to be channels of light. Each of you is called to spread love in
your own way. We call you to constitute a countless number of channels of light
that will open the floodgates of your hearts and let flow the light of truth
and divine love. You will live as living reflections of the light of Christ.
You will be love flowing from Heaven to Earth. You will be fireflies of love,
stars of the new creation.

You who receive these words, know that you are ready.

As channels of light, which in these final times is as it was two thousand
years ago for the apostles, you do not proselytize or seek to convince anyone
of anything. You look for nothing. Why look for what has already been found?
What will never be lost again?

As channels of light you are the living expression of love. This is what you
are invited to be from now on. You are the souls that have passed through holy
love. By letting yourselves be traversed by Him, you have been made one with
Him. By becoming one with Him, you are no longer of the world but have been
reborn in the spirit of God. You are the anointed ones. You are those who from
all eternity were chosen in the design to continue the work of creation, that
is, the endless extension of love. You are those brought into the world to
bring the living Christ to Earth.  You are the channels of the Second Coming of
Christ through whom rivers of grace will flow. You are torrents of love,
blessed clouds that will bring a deluge of blessings, flooding the Earth with
love and truth. You are the true worshippers of the Father, for you worship Him
in spirit and truth. You are those to whom the Father of lights says: Come. Be
my light!

Blessed souls! You who are called to be part of the countless channels of
light, join us, the angels of God. Join with Heaven. Join the love of Mary
Immaculate. Join the living Christ who lives in you. Extend love to the world
so that the Son of God returns to find not only faith on Earth but love,
beauty, and holiness. You are called to be channels of light, the ones who
prepare the Earth for the Immaculate Heart of Mary. You will plant white
lilies, roses, and daisies, and the eternal spouse of souls will come to dwell
among humans. Beloved of Christ, accept this invitation to be a channel of
light. This is the invitation you have been waiting for since you came into the
world, created for you as the personification of the purity and holiness of
God.

Beloved, blessed souls, hear with perfect clarity! Being that for which you
have been created is how to live in perfect happiness. Being a channel of
light is your grace, your destiny and your glory. Although you already know
this, still you wonder what is your specific function. In this call lies your
vocation, because extending love is both the reason for your life and the
fullness of your being. Listen well, beloved of God, as we repeat what your
heavenly Father tells you from the immeasurable immensity of the created
universe: Come, my child. Be my light, now and always.
