## Foreword
{: .ui.header.center.aligned}

This is the second book in the *From the Christ Mind* series. Together they are
meant to be a later day supplement to the incomparable teaching that is *A
Course in Miracles*. Like the Course, the teaching presented in these pages
emanates from the Mind of Jesus of Nazareth. I have written down the teaching
as I have received it; and there has been a careful process of editing and
arranging the material, always guided by Jesus. Always we have tried to make
the teaching as clear as possible; yet it still requires the active engagement
of the mind of the reader. Communication in the world of separation always
requires the joining of two or more minds. 

I suggest you read the words slowly, a few sentences at a time. You need not
rush; eternity is always here and now and awaits only your recognition and
readiness. The words are presented in a way that will both open the mind to the
Truth they are representing, and lead the mind, if you allow it, to a new way
of thinking and understanding. 

I pray this teaching will be of value to all who read these pages, and that it
may help you on your spiritual journey through the world of dreams and back to
your Creator. 

Any errors of content or in the expression of this material are mine and mine
only. For that, I ask the reader's forbearance and forgiveness. 

May God bless you and keep you, and I pray that you may soon awaken as the
Self, the Christ, that you have always been. Thank you. Thank you, Father.
