## I. Being Love

Soul in love, we have come to speak with you and to all who join these
dialogues of love and truth. Today we have brought a message, a memory of
Heaven, a reminder to you and to all who seek peace. This message invites you
to remember that your function is to bring love to the world. This is the
function of all children of God. This function was shown to you with perfect
clarity by your brother, the Christ Jesus. Remember that he, who is the
exemplary life, went out to walk the paths of the world, sowing love and giving
it at every step. He was not without challenges, but always gave love to the
world. All the love that he had in his most sacred heart he shared with the
world and continues to do so in many ways. You who receive these words and
share them are one of those ways, chosen from all eternity, so that the love of
God extends to the whole world, even beyond where you ever imagined.

To be love means to be love at all times and in all places. Observe that where
love is most tested is in worldly interactions. This is because you believe
that love can be obliterated by the world. And in an attempt to prevent this
obliteration, you protect it within the confines of your home, or in the
silence of your privacy. “Nothing will sully the beauty of love,” you say in
the depths of your heart. “Nothing and no one will desecrate the sanctity of
love,” you think secretly. You look at the world and say: “I will not give you
my being, because nothing and nobody will make me lose it.”

My brother! My sister! Protecting the sanctity of your being is what you seek
to do every time you fail to take love into the world. You do this out of
fear—a fear of losing love. We have come to remind you how to release this
fear. You are ready to let go and bring love to the world consciously, not as
an automatic act, but as an integral part of your function on Earth. This
will make the divisions between the external and the internal disappear,
between the world and your being. And you will become more aware every day of
the totality that you truly are. Not only will you feel more a part of
everything, but you will leave behind forever the feeling of separation, which
in reality is but a lack of integrity.

To believe that love can be taken away is to believe something absurd, because
love is eternal and the essence of what you are. Love is what you are, and I
assure you that this is eternally true. The fear of not being—which is what the
fear of losing love really means—has no basis whatsoever. Here lies a great
truth that will set you free. Fear arises from the fear of losing love, which
is the fear of losing yourself.

Today we will bring that pattern of fearful thinking to the light of reason and
let it go.

First, accept that the world has failed you and that you feel a deep
disappointment, because it is true. The world cannot give the mind the security
it seeks, for the egoic mind conceived it. If the totally fearful mind, which
we call the ego, was the creator of the world’s systems, then it cannot find
the solution to the issue of security. Thus, beloved of Heaven, it is essential
that we begin to observe this fear calmly. Observe how the world seems
submerged in panic. The state of terror to which many are subjected is a
visible manifestation of the arrival of the time of light and truth, and that
everything is being healed. It is a sign of true hope. All fear that comes to
light ceases to be, since fear is unconsciousness. Therefore, abandonment of
fear requires its exposure to light.

Now, what part of you is afraid? It is the egoic mind, which is totally fearful
consciousness. This fear is simply a fear of not being, a fear of losing
integrity. This tells us something: that integrity of the mind exists and that
its integrity is the basis of peace. Integrity comes from being certain of its
reality. This is not an exterior matter but an interior one, although it is
projected or extended outward. True certainty of the mind lies in knowing for
sure what it is. This fear is an unequivocal sign that the egoic mind is
ceasing to be. Otherwise it would not be afraid. As egoic consciousness
vanishes, a reaction arises. This reaction is what you can observe in the
world. The convulsion in which the world seems to be submerged is nothing other
than the externalization of that pattern of fear, which causes it to vanish.

## II. A New Humanity

Sisters and brothers from around the world, we come in the glory of the Father
to tell you not to worry. Do not be afraid! The screams being heard are echoes
of the past.  The time has already begun when you can hear the echoes of
holiness. The time has come when you can listen to your hearts and feel how
they beat with the beat of the life that God is. You have taught yourselves
that the last times are ones of great tribulation. This, too, must be
reinterpreted in the light of truth. These great tribulations to which many
refer are nothing other than the great healing process of the universe, a
process in which you are already living and of which you are a part.

Brothers, sisters, listen well. The universal healing has already happened.

We invite you with love to start being actors of your new humanity, of your new
being, here and now. You can—and in a way you must—change your thought
patterns. You are ready. You can start from now on to live without fear of any
kind. This change will seem difficult, but it will not be, because your
consciousness has already evolved enough to be able to modify patterns
consciously. Discipline your mind and from now on you will see miracles arise
every moment. This is faith. Be sure that everything will turn out well, and
everything will be. Fill your hearts with noble feelings and you will see the
sun rise even on the most cloudy day. Live life with a spirit of praise.

Be aware of the need you have to bring love to the world. This need is urgent,
not in the sense of anxiety, but in the sense of its utmost importance. Beloved
soul of the Father! The screams of the world, those echoes of the past that you
still hear, are telling you in thousands of different ways: Brother, do not
deny me love.

Now that you know, what will you do? Deny? No, because you are not now who you
once were. You are a new being; and in your new humanity, you respond with love
to the call for love. Now you begin to bring love to the world consciously, and
thus complete your journey in the fullness of time. Once you have concluded
your part in the way of giving love, you will say happily: “Father, everything
is accomplished. I return to You in the certainty of the peace of a mission
accomplished to which You entrusted me. I brought love to the world and with it
I know You, the source of all love. Now the world is one step closer to Heaven.
Now the world belongs to You because I belong to everyone in You.”

## III. The Strength of Love

Why do you think that love should be safeguarded in a lockbox, under seven
keys, so that it does not contaminate the world? Do you think that love can
contaminate? Do you think that if you only give love, and respond only and
exclusively with love to every circumstance in the world, you will be devoured?
All these questions are the same question, and arise from the same thought. The
fear is to stop being. You do not want to give love for fear of losing it. You
do not want to fear showing the love of your heart, which flows in abundance,
because you know it is divine in nature. You do not want to desecrate the holy.
You do not want to give pearls to swine. Can your brothers or the world can be
considered as such?

Children of God, if you remain always attached to your inner being, to
everything that you think, feel, and experience, embracing everything that
arises within you—be it a feeling or a thought, without judgment of any kind
and in the pure loving contemplation of what is—we assure you that the world
cannot make you lose your center. You will not lose yourself in it as you have
before. Cease believing that what once was, remains. It is not true. What was
left ceased to be because it was never true. Now you are in other times, the
times of Christ, the times of truth.

“The truth will set you free” means that you must remain in the truth that you
are in every moment. If you feel sad, embrace your sadness and tell it with
your inner attitude: “I welcome you. You are part of me and therefore I love
you.” If you perceive overflowing joy, remind yourself that joy is also part of
you and therefore very holy. If what you think you perceive is uncontrolled
anger, tell it also, just as you would with a very angry girl, “I love you, you
are part of me, you are very beautiful. I love you as you are, because you are
a part of me.”

This exercise is not a banal. It is the exercise that will crystallize your
ability to bring love to the world.

For tomorrow, or maybe in a little while, when you cross the door of your home
and go out into the world and find yourself face to face with that universe
that seems incomprehensible, I give you:

I love you, you are part of me, you are very holy. I judged you one day and I
was afraid of you. I did not know you. I did not understand. But that is now
behind. Now I look at you with new eyes, the eyes of Christ. I am willing to
see you through the eyes of love. Now I can tell you in truth: I love you, you
are a part of me just as I am a part of you. I apologize. I judged you. I was
fearful of you. I saw you as cruel and ruthless. I looked at you with distrust.
I could not even sleep in peace, thinking that from somewhere danger would
attack me and tear me apart. Fear haunted me night and day, but not anymore. I
ask for your forgiveness and I forgive myself for all that. I do not want to
live with fear. Now I want to live full of love. I do not want to continue
being afraid. Just as one day I downloaded all my anger onto you, now I release
to you all the love of my heart.

A world that cries out for love is a world worthy of holy compassion.
Therefore, from the divine compassion that exists in your being, let the love
of your heart be poured out on the world. Flood the Earth with your love. You
can do it because you know how to love. It is only necessary to be attentive,
so that only thoughts and feelings of love exist in your mind and heart. Test
it. You will see how everything suddenly changes when you just allow love in
all its forms in your interior. Smile a lot, because a smile is a message you
send to the world, to Heaven, and to your being, a message of love. Sow your
inner garden with the flowers of joy that will never wilt. Speak words of true
hope. Tell happy stories. Cultivate the habit of being happy and sharing the
wisdom of God.

Now we begin to let go of the fears that come from the old experience of having
lost ourselves in the world. We will not lose ourselves anymore. Now the world
is a new world. It is the world that appears in front of us with open hands and
outstretched arms, asking us to give it love. It is a world that says:
“Brother, where you had lost before, now you will find yourself.” This is how
the world ceases to be an enemy with which you entertained yourself by
weaving perennial wars, and becomes your friend on the way back to Heaven. You
will enter the Kingdom together, holding hands.

Soul in love, close your eyes for a moment and recall your purpose of bringing
love to the world. And when you open them again, we assure you that you will no
longer see the old world; you will see the new Heaven shining on you that
reflects the love of God in union with everyone and everything. Once you have
reaffirmed this purpose with faith and sincere love, nothing will be the same.
Do not worry if you believe that your faith is smaller than a mustard seed; the
love of God is greater than anything in creation. You are ready. Trust what you
receive from Heaven. Be ready, today, right now, to bring love to the world and
for the world to be renewed in you. Accept the gratitude of the universe which
will come from your decision to open the floodgates of your heart. Love will
flow to everything, because love always creates new love.

Let yourself be loved. And as soon as you get up from the chair you are in,
start living a new life. A life without fear, a life full of love given to the
world and to everything, now and always.

We give you thanks for giving a face to love!
