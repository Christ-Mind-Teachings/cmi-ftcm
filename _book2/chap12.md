## I. Prelude

Beloved of Heaven, today I come as the Mother of God that I am. I have come to
remind you that everything passes. This truth you already know. As Mother of
all, I remember you with love. Beloved soul, I am by your side always. I notice
all of your needs. I watch over you, as I watch over all of humanity and every
creature, for I am the Mother of everything created. I am the source of life. I
am the one who has given life to everything that exists. I am life in
abundance. I am love.

Pure soul, beauty of Heaven! I invite you to think more about this great truth
that we remember together today: Everything ends. The world of time and form is
perishable. Bodies will pass. Youth will pass like a spring flower. Projects of
men will pass. Nations will pass. The sun and planets will pass. The passenger
will cease because he is a passenger. Everything of time will pass. But my love
will never pass. That which is eternal never passes. In this simple truth lies
your peace.

Your bitterness and pain often come from a misunderstanding about permanence
and time. Time was provided so that material creation has a beginning and an
end. This is the intrinsic reality of time. Time is not an endless continuum.
Eternity is the realm of no-time, the realm where everything happens because
everything is eternal. Eternity is the realm of perfect love which is alone
eternal and therefore alone real. Everything else is wrapped up in the cloak
of time and in due time will cease to exist. In other words, Heaven is the
realm where nothing passes ways, since it is eternal. Love never passes away.
Illusion is the realm in which everything passes away. That is why we should
never be afraid of anything because everything passes way except for Love.

Children, love will never cease, nor will truth or wisdom pass away, because
they are the same. This truth must be united to the truth that says everything
passes away. A correct understanding is necessary in order to live in the
wisdom of God, and be happy in a peace that has no opposite. Wisdom is your
destiny. Wisdom is the science of love because it is true knowledge.
Therefore when living in wisdom you will be at peace. Your bitterness often
comes from confusion between the eternal and the perishable. Once the veil of
time is drawn back, wisdom will shine in all its glory before you, and you will
be able to see face-to-face the truth and the love that never ends.

## II. Time and Eternity

Clinging to the transient as if it were eternal reveals a lack of
understanding. This mistake will be resolved as you discover the sweet taste of
the wisdom of love and no longer wish to live without the joy of truth.
Clinging to the transient as if it were eternal is painful. Such an
attachment moves you farther from truth. If you cling to what sooner or later
will no longer be, and consider it essential for your happiness, you will fear
its loss. This fear of loss is often unrecognized. Acceptance is necessary for
you to integrate and transcend. We save love now by removing the fear of loss
from your hearts and minds, for it is a fear that comes from a lack of
understanding. If you embrace the wisdom of love it fades away easily and
causes no more pain.

The fear of losing what you love causes suffering because the loss of something
you love activates a painful memory. That memory causes you to relive the pain
of separation, which was perceived as the loss of love. When the separation
arose, the pain of uprooted love was immense. Just as a beautiful flower
suffers and finally faints when it is torn from the fertile Earth, when the
rebellion against love arose, you felt a dismemberment of your being. The pain
was so intense that it was experienced and recorded as a daze of untold
proportions in the separated mind. Such a traumatic experience wounded the
soul. That soul wound, caused by the denial of being, is what we will uncover
today so that finally my Immaculate Heart, the ointment for wounds, will heal
forever this error of perception.

Daughters and sons of a wisdom that is not of the world! Listen with calm
attention and keep what is said in the silence of your heart. If you ever
forget, do not worry; I will always be by your side and I will do in you what
you think you cannot do. Remember, my beloved, that we are one—one heart, one
mind, one holy love, one truth.

I repeat so often that you live in the presence of love, that you love one
another and express love in any of the endless forms that true love can adopt
because in your souls is a deep yearning to live in eternity. To fully satisfy
that desire, you must live in love. Love is eternal. Love is your being. Love
is what eternally remains. It is what you truly are. When you search for love,
you search for eternity. When you search for what completes you, you search for
the eternal. You are searching for your being. To lose love, if that were
possible, would be to lose one’s being—to cease being. No one wants to stop
being; that would be soul death.  Love is essential for life. This is not a new
commandment, but simply the condition of divine reality, the foundation of
truth. What is separated from love ceases to be. What is united in love is all
that is. This is inescapable. And every moment within the love of God, which
manifests in infinite ways, you encounter yourself.

To live with love is to live in the Kingdom of Heaven. This is eternal life.
This is Christ: Christ is Heaven because Christ is love. Letting your whole
life be lived by the Christ who lives in you, will release you from the fear of
loss forever. You will realize that the only thing you need is to be the love
that you truly are. If you are love, you give love. Christ shines in you, and
you live in God’s peace.

That is why it is so important that you often remember that everything passes.
So I repeat: worries shall pass, pain shall pass, life on Earth shall pass, but
your being shall never pass. You are eternal. Therefore I invite you to let
nothing trouble you, let nothing scare you, whatever may seem to happen. When
you immerse yourself in the depths of the heart, you will feel the certainty
that comes from the remembrance that everything passes, the good and the not
good, but love, like the word of God, never passes.

My daughters and sons, do not cling to the ephemeral. Cling to my Immaculate
Heart and to the most Sacred Heart of my divine son Jesus. In this union of our
hearts you will find forever the certainty and love for which your heart longs.
Come, drink from the fountain of life. Come, rest in the arms of your Mother,
who gave you life and sustains your existence. When everything passes, our love
will shine and we will forever sing together of the mercies of love.
