## I. Salvific Love

My children, I am the Mother of love and therefore the Mother of Wisdom. Today
I have come to be with you once again, surrounded by the glory of the Father
whose glory is also yours. Remember that God does not keep anything for
Himself. He shares everything. Today I come to remind you to live in mercy. To
forgive others without forgiving yourself is a mistake. All are in need of
forgiveness, both to forgive and be forgiven.

Sons and daughters of light, in your heart are pains that still pierce your
soul, fears that you have not yet released, that prevent you from embracing the
light of love. Your pain is the pain you feel for the evil you think you have
done. That pain, that guilt, is what I speak of today, to let the conscience of
Christ heal your wounds forever.

You have to understand, or rather, remember once again, that physical or mental
illnesses, accidents, crises, or what you might call everyday problems—a
financial bankruptcy, a divorce, deceit, or mistakes of all kinds—are but
“events” or relationships that come to you from the pure love of God. They come
in perfect union with your will. They are a grace—all of them. This means that
there is nothing in your life that is not perfect. Everything that happens to
you happens to God. There is nothing that you experience that God does not
experience. When your body feels the joy of fresh water on your hands, so does
God. The Father and you are one.

Everything works together for a higher good. God is a Father and a Mother who
loves with salvific love. This cannot mean that he is away or separated. God is
not apart from you. You and God are one. You are part of Him. What I want to
say to you, beloveds of holiness, is that universal love, the source of
creation, has perfect wisdom. In its perfect wisdom it has aligned all things
so that the purpose of your creation is fulfilled without delay or detour. God
has not erred in calling you to life. He was not mistaken when from eternity He
thought up the kind of life that you would have on the physical plane, the
experience of human life.

Children of love! Nothing can happen in your life that is not in divine
thought. Nothing can happen other than that which can help you become aware of
uncreated truth. This is the truth that makes you free. It is what will show
you who you truly are. When you recognize who you truly are, you recognize the
love that you truly are. In that recognition you become aware of your unity
with God. If you are love—and I assure you that you are— you cannot be
different from the love that God is. There is only one love, and that is God.
You know this but often forget. Everything is in the hands of God. Not a hair
falls from your head without His consent. It is this truth upon which
forgiveness is always justified.

I speak forgiveness here, given its importance on your path to the permanent
peace of God. Throwing blame onto others is as alien to love as putting blame
on yourself, like a heavy burden you might carry or drag along. Drop the bundle
now! Do not carry a cross you were never asked to carry. Sons and daughters
of God, that was not what was meant when you were told to “carry your cross and
follow me.” What was meant is that you take charge of the creative mental and
emotional process within by which you inherently co-create.

Everything you attract in your life is perfect because, in agreement with
God, it is what you have created as your experience on Earth. Accept the fact
that it is you—and only you—that fabricates guilt and scatters it about.
Recall that it was said, “He who does not gather with me, scatters.” That is
what we are remembering today: to stop spreading guilt and to start gathering
the harvest that is already yours, that together we sowed. It is about finally
abandoning the blame habit, the habit of assigning guilt for the apparent
blunders of life.

Blessed soul, you are ready to accept that all the evil you think you have
committed, all the damage you think you have caused, even from incapacity or
unconsciousness, is past. What you did cannot be modified, nor is it necessary
to do so. It is only necessary to recognize that it is past, and be willing
to put it in the hands of forgiveness so that Christ can perform the miracle.
You will not lack opportunities to do this. Henceforth the events of life will
not have for you the same meaning as before, although they may seem to arrive
in the same way, even with the same characters and scenarios.

## II. The Consciousness of Being Healthy

You will now be aware of events that have you feel pain as healings performed
in your deep interior. Awareness of healings are necessary. From now on, if you
experience a physical illness, a divorce, a bankruptcy, or are involved in
any type of accident, deceit, or similar thing, understand— and remember
well—that a gift of God’s love has arrived. Such a gift may seem to be
something quite different, but it is certainly a gift of divine grace, a gift
that love brings, so that the healing that has already occurred in your soul
passes to consciousness.

Son of Love that God is! You have healed. It is necessary to consciously accept
that you have already healed. It is for this reason that your being acts in
perfect communion to bring to the surface of the physical or emotional body
matters which have already healed, to bring them to light and to integrate
them. In other words, the apparently sick body makes you aware that healing has
already happened. Similarly with other things that seem to happen and can bring
you painful memories. Painful memories that are triggered, that evoke and
provoke unwanted emotions, are not a punishment from God. They are messengers
to remind you that you have healed, and are asking you to accept the healing.
They are messengers saying: Brother, sister, let go of the past and forgive
yourself now!

Not everything that you consider painful should be unwanted. Not everything you
have called guilt is actually guilt. The misunderstanding of guilt is an
important source of conflict that we dismantle now. You are living in a world
that has created a myriad of judgments towards feelings as good or bad, right
or wrong. Some are considered desirable, others undesirable. But such labels
are contrary to the truth. Life does not label. The fear of feeling is a basic
fear. It manifests itself in resisting certain emotions. Often these include
anger and physical impulses.

Your fear of feelings arises from a fear of losing control. The mind fears the
heart, for the heart speaks a language that the thinking mind cannot
understand. This is the apparent reality of the mind-heart separation. The
cradle of all fear is that which cannot be understood by the mind, which it
perceives as a threat to its integrity and must be attacked. The mind would
configure reality according its own laws. To the mind, feelings and emotions
are a threat because they come from a place beyond it and outside of its
control.

Since in the past certain emotions seemed to dominate you, now the memory of
the mechanism that sought to reject them has been activated. Your repression of
them left a memory in your psychic and physical bodies that needs to be
deprogrammed. Deprogramming, in this context, means healing memory. Every
record of fear recorded by the body and the separated mind must be erased. Only
forgiveness that comes from the love of Christ can and will do this. But your
willingness is required, to forgive seventy times seven if necessary.

## III. Fear of Feeling

Let us further consider the mental mechanism of the fear of feeling. Hatred or
fear arouses in the thinking mind a terror of losing its integrity. To deal
with it, it created an automatic emotional response mechanism that led you to
repress certain emotions as soon as possible, or to flee from the circumstance
that may have aroused them. Avoidance of the defense-attack mechanism was a
response that may in the past have helped you deal with certain situations, but
it has no usefulness now. You have left the ego behind and are well grounded in
the light of truth, so it will not be difficult for you to let go of these
mechanisms. Guilt has a preponderant place in what you dealt with
relentlessly in the past. Now we will integrate guilt into love.

Guilt is an emotion, a false feeling which is a thought reflected in the body,
not a true feeling, which is thought of the true self, expressed in the heart.
In other words, fear is an emotion, an illusion, whereas feelings are the
expression of love. All guilt is a response to something you perceive in
yourself and consider inadequate or unworthy of yourself. Guilt is so common
that it has become a habit, and a merciless one. Mercy is a response of love
and of truth. God is not only love but also mercy, just as you are both love
and mercy.

In the past you have done things that perhaps created situations that seemed
painful to others. To continue to blame yourself is to lack love and mercy
for yourself. It also reflects a lack of understanding. Every event in your
life has perfection in God and is pure love, as it is with each one of your
brothers and sisters. Realize also that they summoned you so that, through you,
those circumstances you consider undesirable could arise. They had something to
learn from them, just as you did. Sons and daughters of truth, you summon to
yourselves in time that which you have agreed to outside of time, in the
covenant of souls. No encounter is casual. Nothing happens by chance. Maybe you
do not like what you have done, or what others have done to you. Everyone has
feelings of disgust towards themselves, towards others, and towards life. But
that you do not like something does not justify attack.

You are not part of events involving others by chance, nor are they. They need
you, not only in what seems to be desirable and pleasant but frequently in what
seems not to be. They must also forgive you and themselves in the same way you
do. Just as they give you an opportunity to forgive, you give likewise to them.
This dynamic applies not only to your brothers and sisters but also to things,
events, and even ideas. This mechanism of union occurs through the pact souls
have made outside of time because its purpose is holy.

Where, then, is any reason for guilt? Do you think the damage you have done
cannot be corrected? If so, you are wrong. All true forgiveness presupposes the
correction of mistakes. And since true forgiveness comes from Christ and not
from the thinking mind, then Christ also does the correction. Do not seek to
correct the error in your own way, for that is the old mechanism of the ego.
The ego, in its arrogance, believed that it could forgive and correct, and
frequently did so in its own way, without achieving anything.

## IV. God’s Peace

My sons and daughters, the peace of God is your inheritance. Forgive yourself
as God has always forgiven you, or, better understood, there is nothing to
forgive.  You are simply traveling the path of life in human experience,
learning in your own way in a trial-and-error manner. Mistakes are an essential
part of that process. It could not be otherwise in a world of opposites.
Success, error, success, error. A dualistic world is experienced in dual
consciousness. You have made mistakes. Everyone has. They are part of the human
experience. But it does not have to be like this any more. We have entered in a
new era, a new experience, the experience of living in the certainty of a
wisdom that is not of the world. We no longer live in trial-and-error duality.
We live now in truth.

Beloveds of God! Everything that happened, happened. We let it go. We let God
solve it in God’s own way. Do you think God would leave His children with the
harm that you could cause? God knows that everything is neutral. He knew that
you would make mistakes and also that from those errors there would come fruits
of holiness, both for you and your brothers and sisters.

The Holy Spirit uses every mistake for your growth and the growth of others.
God, in his infinite wisdom, conceived a plan for restoration even before you
made a mistake. Leave forgiveness and correction in God’s hands. Remember
that spiritual growth is a grace. Leave your sisters and brothers in the hands
of love, just as you already are. Trust in the wisdom of God. Start enjoying
the journey of life. Be merciful to yourself and others. They may not yet have
reached the point of being with themselves, but that is not your business.
Everyone has their way. Yours belongs to you. Everyone has his Goliath, and
each one has the pebble with which to slay Goliath. That pebble is called
mercy.

Children of God, is it too much to ask for you to be merciful to yourselves?
