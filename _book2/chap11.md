## I. The Power of Will

My love, pure soul! We love you with a perfect love. We have come through the
will of the Father for the love of all humanity. We thank you for your Yes to
wisdom that is not of the world. Today we continue with the theme of the
previous session, given the vastness of its meaning. It is important to
remember that the totality of the fullness of love can never be grasped, but
this is not a cause for either worry or spiritual laziness. To have a loving
attitude towards wisdom— your eternal mother, the source of your being—is to
love what you truly are. To be willing to be informed through the shining of
truth, which is the name we give to eternal wisdom, is to let yourself be
loved. Everything comes from the wisdom of God. You yourself are its
expression. Therefore, wisdom is your destiny, your achievement, and your
being.

Today we let go of the fear of the power of your will, of which we have already
spoken but now see in a new light. In the past you experienced the power of
your will and became afraid of it, since you believed that it led you to
perdition. You were afraid of what you did with your life, and you know that,
in one way or another, it was your will that directed it.

You have tried to convince yourself that nothing was your responsibility, that
nothing was the result of your will, that what happened in your life was the
whim of fate, a fate that sometimes gave you a something sweet, then deceived
you and took it away, replacing it with a poisoned apple, whereupon you sank
into a dream of oblivion, ignorance, and unconsciousness of your true self. For
all this you blame yourself—your will. We have already spoken of blame; you
know there is no difference between blaming others and blaming yourself.

How could you not fear something so frightening? Is a power that seems to have
configured your conscious existence so far— undesirable at least, painful at
worst—not fearful? The power of your will is immense, even immeasurable. You
fear it above all fears. The power of your will is the power of God, which is
the power of love. Because you feared it, you chose to enslave it to reduce its
power. You wished to subdue and control the power of your will. When you were
repeatedly told to “let yourself be loved,” it was meant to trust and “let
yourself go,” as your will permits.

Constraining your will reduces your freedom and your consciousness. To not be
conscious of your whole being is what is meant by separation, or a lack of
fulfillment. You did not consciously separate from God. You did not consciously
separate yourself from your sisters and brothers, otherwise you could not
have come into existence, nor would you be so faithful to the human experience.
Nor did you separate yourself from life, for you want to live and to exist—even
expressing yourself in ways that often go beyond what sanity would advise. To
live in freedom is to free your will from the tyranny of the ego to which you
have subjected yourself for so long.

The ego was presented to you as an alien being, something separate from you, to
make it easier for you to distance yourself and transcend the illusory part of
your mind. Wisdom used an indirect approach, so you might detach yourself from
the untrue part of you. Nevertheless, the ego is your deliberate decision to do
other than God’s will. Your decision. The ego is the result of your choice, not
in truth but in the illusion, although this distinction is irrelevant now.

The ego is based in ignorance because it assumes that something alien to God
can exist. Thus it was your pseudo-creation: a world where something can appear
to be accomplished that is not the will of God. It is somewhat like a child who
goes to his room, locks the door and hides under the bed, to do something
contrary to his mother’s will. It believes that the toy hidden from her gaze,
in rebellion, would not be taken away. With such a belief you created a will
alien to God. Then you left paradise and hid because of the shame you felt.

## II. Will and Desire

Holy brothers and sisters, you are ashamed of yourselves, of what you are, and
of what you have done with your lives, both individually and collectively. You
see so much foolishness and cruelty in the world and are ashamed of human
nature. Today we recognize that shame, accept it, and then release it forever.
It has no foundation.

Shame is disabling, and in order to release it we must accept, once and for
all, the truth: that fear is the denial of God’s will. It is hate; a lack of
love; the wish for your will to prevail over God’s. There is a direct
relationship between your fear and your rebellion against the will of God.
You should be aware, however, that actually you and God agree on almost
everything except on this matter of will.

Not doing God’s will is not doing your will either, because God and you are
one. You know this intellectually, but intellectual knowledge is not
sufficient. Not doing the will of God deprives you of freedom. And a will that
is not free is intrinsically contradictory, since the will must be free to be
what it is. Thus, not living harmoniously with the will of love is not doing
your own will.

You must also accept that anger arises in you when you do not follow your own
will. Every time you notice yourself doing something unwillingly, then not only
is there anger, but it leads to error. Doing what you do not want to do for the
mere fact of pleasing the apparent will of another, sooner or later generates
suffering because part of you rebels. Anger is the messenger telling you that
you are not acting from your own will, that you are doing what you do not want
to do.

There is a connection between will and desire. This association must be
understood more clearly. Anger with yourself comes from your thwarted will,
which you blame for decisions you consider wrong in your life. All this arises
from confusion. What you consider “your will” was not your true will, but
simply your wish.

Confusing wishes or desires with the will is common because the ego created
desire to replace the will. God does not desire. The will does not desire, it
allows. Being guided by the desires of the ego has been the way you have lived
prior to this time of freedom. There was no other option while you were identi-
fied with the ego, a body, and a personality. It would be foolish to blame
yourself; you could not help identifying with desires because you considered
them part of your will. Thus you became a slave to desire and you felt a loss
of freedom. It is quite absurd to believe that something as unstable as desire
could come from the true will of God. It is one thing to follow your will; it
is altogether different to dedicate yourself to satisfying your desires or
whims, or those of others. Satisfaction of needs of all kinds is the maxim of
the ego.

Sisters and brothers in Christ, the ego cannot do otherwise. Do not blame the
ego, or the ego of others. It is what the ego is. Accept what is, as it is. To
accept in this manner is to reconcile yourself with the ego world. Do not
pretend that the ego is different from what it is, or try to change or subdue
it. Let the ego be what it wants to be while you remain established in the
truth of who you are. Remember, the universe has room for everyone and
everything, including the ego. Therefore do not be concerned about the ego’s
tireless “tricks” that keep you confused between desires and will. You need not
remain in that sea of fear.

Your will is powerful. Fear it not. Calmly trust that the Divine Will will
guide you beyond your thinking mind and all the world’s reasoning. Welcome the
power of love that lives in your being and let it expand.

## III. Release

Sons and daughters, beloveds! Leave behind the old wishes that guided your
actions and your life. Desires are loud but blind and deaf. If a blind person
guides you, you will fall into a ditch. You have felt that fall. Being guided
by the thinking mind and consequently by desires and needs, you lost your way.
By letting the thinking mind master your life you were led to error. The
thinking mind, that is, your own interpretations which come from the wisdom
of the world and from your attachment to the lower mind, is what has enslaved
your will. We have already spoken about the tyranny of the ego-mind, or
thinking mind, over your life and the liberation that has already happened. Now
all that remains is simply to live in freedom.

We are repeating this is because the pattern of thinking that says the problems
of life must be solved by means of the old methods of egoic thought is still
active, though with less and less force. This old pattern is almost gone. Soon
it will disappear.

The time has come to let go of the attachment to the reasoning of the thinking
mind. It has enslaved you—not the true mind that has been given to you, the
mind of Christ, but that habit of looking for explanations on your own to give
meaning to everything. To think on your own, individually or collectively, is
to think without God. That is what is meant by making a will alien to the will
of the Creator.

You think that the thinking mind helped you to survive. And you consider it a
great achievement to have dedicated yourself to trying to solve the riddles of
life. You also consider that this part of the mind is what defines your
superiority in relation to other beings, at least those who you consider less
intelligent. Is it not true that the world considers human intelligence to be a
trait of superiority and competitive advantage with other beings, if not with
everything created? This love of logical intelligence and your consideration of
it as your guide to everything is what we will release today, because it is not
grounded in love, but is an attachment which comes from fear.

Holy sons and daughters! Let your mind go today. It will go without making a
fuss. You are ready to let your life be led by the wisdom of God rather than
the intelligence of the world. One is given freely and will never fail you,
because it is God himself and surpasses all reasoning. About the other, you
already know.

What a joy to know that you are ready to be free, free from exhausting
interpretations and the speculative thinking of the lower mind. You do not need
it. You never needed it. Believe us when we tell you that attachment to that
part of the mind is what prevents you from being free and from living in the
fullness of love. Cease to value it so highly, for it never gave you anything
that your will has truly arranged. Many still mistakenly believe that that
part of the mind, the habit to think speculatively without anchoring into the
wisdom of love, is what allowed advancement through technology and science. But
you do not believe that any more, nor do those who are united in the truth of
Christ, because you know it is not true. You know that human intelligence, as
you call it, has given you as many advances as setbacks.

Today we open our minds and hearts to feel comfortable with the freedom that is
already ours. We begin to live in peace and joy with the fact that our mind no
longer thinks, nor does it need to. Now the Christ in us thinks. Now we leave
intelligence aside and welcome wisdom.
