Thank you my brother for your efforts on behalf of us all and your dedication
to our single purpose. Let every step on the journey home be guided by the Holy
Spirit, and do not worry if at times you seem to falter or grow weary. The
journey may seem long and arduous, the goal far off and beyond your vision; all
will come right in the end. You need only do your part each day to the best of
your ability, ask for help, and trust in the help you are given. Everything you
need in any way will be available when you need it. 

Do not forget Who goes with you every step of the way and remember, when doubt
and fear may arise, their meaningless source and illusory nature. Nothing will
or can prevent you from returning to your Source and True Condition as the One
Self. Your Father waits for you and all the angels will rejoice as you walk
through the Gates of Heaven and disappear into the Heart of God.
