## I. Prelude

Beloved of God, right from Heaven! Today we have come as messengers of love, as
a multitude of angels of Heaven. We are the unity of truth. We are the love of
the manifested Father, just as you and all are. Sons and daughters of the
highest! In our hearts is an inextinguishable fire of passionate love, which
comes from the source of creation and radiates brilliantly throughout the
universe. We are the fire of God, the everlasting agape. We are the flame of
living love, a flame that embraces with warmth and tenderness everything that
exists in God.

Close your eyes for a moment. Shut out the world. Remove worry from your mind,
for none of it is real. Appease your emotions. Temper your soul. Immerse
yourselves in the depths of the infinite ocean of your being and be silent in
our presence. Feel the warmth of our love. Expand your mind and heart. Allow
the tenderness that springs from our being to wrap you entirely. Join our love
and together we will spread God’s love. Feel the remembrance of union as it
dawns upon your memory. Feel the tenderness of love. Stay here, in the presence
of love, and listen as we call you to peace. Listen to the voice of love.

## II. The End of Time

Beloveds of Heaven, you live in the last times. This should not be cause for
concern. It simply is what it is. Time will end sooner or later. An end always
comes. God himself has contemplated the end of time, and ordered all things for
a higher good. Therefore to worry about the end of time is nonsensical for
you who know that God loves with an active love.

The phrase “final times” must be resignified, because it has been loaded with
fear and foolishness. The “end of time” really refers to the era of the
fullness of time in which all that is true begins to be seen and recognized.
Sisters and brothers in love, both individually and collectively you are
already beginning to perceive the light of Christ. This will not stop, but
rather more and more will be seen; less and less of truth will be denied. The
light will illuminate everything. Nothing will be out of the reach of truth.
Everything will be known. Everything that is true will be seen with perfect
clarity. Only holiness will shine. The rest will pass, never to return.
Illusion will give way to truth.

Sisters and brothers, the time of fullness has begun!

This new era of the fullness of time is signaled by the breaking down of
structures. Both the individual mind and the collective mind—which are one—go
through a transition from old structures to a new concept of the universe.
This new worldview, or consciousness, is nothing other than the crumbling of
the old and the emergence of the new. This process will trigger a sense of
disorientation and fear among those who do not understand or cannot accept the
signs of the times.

Dismemberment of old structures prevents the mind from taking refuge in old
beliefs, as all is subjected to the loving scrutiny of the tribunal of truth.
Everything increasingly comes to light as the mind loosens its adherence to
beliefs. The mind is uniting with truth. Mind and heart come together in love.
The boundaries assigned to labels blur. You can observe this already in
existing structures. Families are no longer defined as before. Genres are no
longer such and such. What was thought to be good ceases to be good, and
likewise the bad.

Some will panic in the midst of this process of destructuring and
disorientation. So much fear comes to light. Where old structures once gave
security, they no longer are a safe haven. Neither do you want them, for the
mind seeks integrity, a refuge of peace. The same goes for the heart. A refuge
must always be in reality. Thus the united mind and heart seek to understand
reality, to know it, to be safe and at peace. In other words, the only real
security comes from certainty. Where there is certainty there is peace. Thus
many who do not yet understand true authority will suffer from fear. They cling
to the past, to an old world.

## III. Certainty

Today we have come to shed light on the matter of authority. By means of this
clarification we will leave behind the fear that comes from the chaos that many
of you feel. Brothers and sisters, there is no chaos in God and none in your
being. Therefore it is to your being that we appeal. You know that many of your
brothers and sisters feel a deep fear when confronted with chaos, without
secure authority figures. If systems of government no longer give safe answers,
nor the religious or social institutions such as the family, nor the group, nor
the spiritual gurus, then where do you look for security? In the old? Some will
answer yes, given their resistance to change.

Those who refuse to abandon the old and wish to return to old rigid ways, to a
reality of white and black, take refuge in what they know. This is why your era
is so consumed by judicialization. Justice systems—and frequently the mass
media—become substitutes for authority. Where law abounds, sin abounds. Many
resort to these structures to “ask for help,” to define what is good and what
is not, and to put order to the chaos that the crumbling of the old seems to
create. Observe, soul in love, how the scream for authority resounds throughout
the world. Knowing how to understand this scream will give you peace, since you
are also part of it in one way or another.

You are not where you are by chance. Nothing is an accident. You are in this
time because you chose to be in it, in perfect harmony with the will of God.
This is because what you are has the power and potential to contribute to the
plan of atonement in a unique and particular way. The contribution that only
your being can offer is the one that you have come to accomplish. And you will.
All will. Everything will, because every aspect of creation is part of God’s
plan. You contribute to the collapse of the old and the creation of the new.
You are an inseparable part of the process. Everyone contributes in his or her
own way. Everyone is bringing the truth to light.

Within the universal plan of the ascension of consciousness, you are a link of
light in an extensive luminescent chain which extends from the origin of
separation to the fullness of time, and from there to the fullness of love. You
are part of what breaks down the old and creates the new. You have created this
chaos so that the new can be born. The cycles of creation, destruction, and
re-creation exist, and you are part of that eternal creative process. Some have
called this “the game of life” or “the dice of God.” But, my beloved, can God
really play dice or a game of chance? Obviously not. There is no such thing as
God’s dice. There is only perfect harmony in everything. Everything is perfect
as it is, including you and the whole world.

What seems to be a game of chance is not God’s creation, but the erroneous
interpretation that the egoic mind made of life. Faced with a world perceived
as fraudulent because the symbols of external authority seem to have failed and
cannot give security, nor give definitions that serve, nor give certainty to
the mind and heart, the reaction is panic and fear. This projection is what
makes people sue each other as never before in judicial systems. This is why
public authorities are overwhelmed and fail to provide adequate answers. The
same dynamic overwhelms the health systems. These systems, like all systems
based on illusion, cannot give secure answers or certainty. They are simply
systems that will be completely replaced, as everything will be. Remember that
we have already said that what was once good for everyone is now bad for some
and not for others. What was white is now gray. The tree of the science of good
and evil has withered and begun to fade. It is hardly surprising that many will
cling to imagined financial security, or to the body.

What is this all about?

The time has come to return to true authority: an authority that does not
change, that is not weak, that always provides certainty, that is not brittle,
that does not need repeated demonstrations of its apparent power.

## IV. The Authority of Love

There is only one true authority and that is God. Every time humankind tried to
remove God and power from being the authority over all things, it has fallen
into tyrannies or nonsense. Why? For the simple reason that all true authority
comes from truth. Only in the truth can there be perfect certainty. If you
appeal to systems whose foundations are illusion, you will sooner or later be
disillusioned. You will feel disappointed by life, by the thought systems of
the world, and by everything learned from worldly wisdom. This, in turn, will
create a state of anguish and bitterness. The return to the authority of love
will make all this anguish change.

The change that the world seeks has already begun. It is being propelled by
Christ, who is love. Although you cannot fully understand it yet, you actively
contribute to this process of the emergence of the new world. You do it out of
love and according to the design of the Eternal. You do it as an integral part
of the expiatory covenant agreed upon with God before time. At the foot of the
tree of the science of good and evil, at exactly the moment that its fruit was
eaten, this process of the emergence of a new Heaven and a new Earth of which
you are part began to roll, with your full consent. Rejoice in knowing that you
are the saviors of the world. You are the chosen ones, all, so that the light
of Christ shines in every place. You are the channels of the light of Heaven.
You are Christ. Your strength is indescribably superior than you usually
recognize.

Notice, children of the Most High, how far you have come in the atonement.
Notice how high you have risen in the ascension of your human nature. Fear
nothing. The time in which you live is a time of blessings, a time of return to
the true authority of truth and love. Let yourself be carried away by love and
you will feel safe. Let yourself be loved and you will find the certainty of
love in your life. Live in the only possible certainty, the certainty of being
who you really are. Certainty comes from knowing oneself in the light of the
holiness that God is.

You have clung to old systems that have never worked and never will work. Hold
on to love. Hold on to Christ. This will work. The conscience of Christ is what
from now on must be your authority, your only guide and support.

Beloved of God, make the love that you truly are the only source of your
knowledge and action, so that you can live in the perfect certainty of the
truth that says, “Only love exists because only love is real.”

Blessed are the children of light.
