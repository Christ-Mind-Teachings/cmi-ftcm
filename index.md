##  From the Christ Mind
{: .ui.header}

<div class="page-introduction" markdown="1">

*The Christ has need of helpers in the world of form and separation. Each one
brings a Light that shines away all darkness. Each one bears a message of Love
and hope, of resurrection and the end of death’s harsh rule.*

*You’re the One. You’re the One He needs.*

*Without you, there is no salvation.*

What is presented here is a timeless sacred teaching. From the Foreword by
Darrell Morley Price in 2012 “The teaching presented in these pages is the
result of a collaboration between the Mind of Jesus of Nazareth and myself.
This teaching to put it simply and directly, has been scribed. The content, the
ideas, as well as the form in which they are expressed, have been received
directly from the Mind of Jesus and written down as they were received&hellip;
The process of transmission and reception was simple and direct. In full
conscious awareness, in a relaxed and receptive state of mind, I would receive
the first words or phrase of a sentence through a kind of inner hearing. As I
wrote them down, more words would come until the sentence was complete. Then
the next sentence would begin. I never knew at the beginning of a sentence, how
it would end.”
